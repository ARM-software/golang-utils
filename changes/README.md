# Changes directory

This directory comprises information about all the changes that happened since the last release.

A [news file](../CONTRIBUTING.md#news-files) should be added to this directory for each PR.

On release of the package, the content of the file becomes part of the [change log](../CHANGELOG.md) and this directory is reset.
