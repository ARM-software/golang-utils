## Overview
 
This repository contains various helpers and utilities for Golang in order to do actions not available in the standard library.
It was initially developed for numerous projects at Arm, including some running in production, in order to apply the DRY principle.

Few helpers may be themselves leveraging 3rd party libraries.
